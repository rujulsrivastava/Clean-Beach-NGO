                    Cleaning up the World's Ocean One Stream at a time</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Plastic seems to make up over 40% of litter.
                    From streets to urban streams, into rivers, then the
                    Ocean, one stream at a time. Study’s
                    reflect 5 countries make up over 60% of all pollution getting
                    into the ocean.
                    One reason to volunteer with Clean Beach
                    Please is cleaning up the ocean one steam at a time. We
                    remove over
                    10,000 pounds of litter from waterways every year, thanks to volunteers like you.
                    CBP's goals are to empower communities and
                    beyond by providing planning and providing technical
                    assistance to landowners, communities, and
                    local governments. Our main focus and goal is to improve
                    urban water
                    quality by using a holistic ecosystem
                    based approach that synergistically reduces pollutants
                    entering the
                    river, prevents erosion, and provides
                    wildlife habitat. Through the process of restoration, we are
                    providing environmental education,
                    connecting people in the community to their natural environment,
                    and improving biodiversity.</p>
                <br>
                <h4><b>Conservation goals/outcomes:</b></h4>
                <p>The goal of this project is to restore habitat
                    for threatened riparian animal species by improving
                    water quality and stream stability with an
                    ecological restoration approach. Native plants will be
                    established throughout 50% of the stream
                    section after removing invasive species such as Reed Canary
                    Grass.
                    Through partnership local schools, cities,
                    and neighbors in community capacity building service
                    learning
                    project.</p>
                <br>
                <h4><b>Scientific goals/outcomes:</b></h4>
                <p>Pre-implementation includes invasive species
                    removal and establishing 50% native plants. The
                    completion of
                    the project follows with post-
                    implementation water quality monitoring and project effectiveness,
                    including weekly
                    water samples for three years, frequent
                    plant monitoring, and using strategies to maintain
                    consistent water temperatures
                    to improve survival rates. With Oregon
                    State University interns, CBP tracks animal species through
                    waterfowl counts and
                    amphibian counts using frog traps.</p>
                <br>
                <h4><b>Project methodology:</b></h4>
                <p>The restoration and protection of natural
                    watershed process is the foundation of achieving watershed health.
                    Since natural watershed processes have
                    been eliminated, altered or reduced in many areas, habitat
                    restoration
                    activities are the primary method for
                    reintroducing the necessary functions to watersheds that have
                    been altered
                    due to past management practices and/or
                    disturbance events. This includes, but is not limited to
                    improving water
                    quality, water quantity, habitat
                    complexity, floodplain interaction, vegetation structure, and
                    species diversity.</p>
                <br>
                <h4><b>Vision:</b></h4>
                <p>Our Vision is to lower Nutrients like
                    nitrogen, phosphorus, and E, Coli from animal waste on The
                    Ocean Cost.
                    Our goal of restoration is to create a
                    self supporting ecosystem that is resilient to perturbation
                    without further assistance.</p>
                <br>
                <h4><b>Healthy Trees:</b></h4>
                <p>Healthy trees, healthy Cities, equals, healthy
                    Communities for Oregonians: CBP will be using provided funds to implement
                    watershed and wildlife enhancement of our community service learning projects for the community.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4><b>Rivers:</b></h4>
                <p>The restoration of rivers, where we will
                    enhance not only our community but the economic value of a
                    city in many ways,
                    by planting trees and green spaces in
                    urban areas provide more than aesthetic benefits. Where there
                    are trees, there are
                    reduced energy costs, decreased storm
                    water treatment costs, increased property values, increased
                    spending at stores,
                    increased employee satisfaction, and lower
                    healthcare costs through cleaner air and increased
                    recreational opportunities.</p>
                <br>
                <h4><b>Urban Streams:</b></h4>
                <p>Urban streams can be a great tool to filter water, if abundance of flora and fauna is thriving.
                    Native plants and trees,
                    can not only filter but provide a stream
                    canopy that allows a consistent water temperature for native salmonids species.
                    Water from urban streams flow downhill
                    ending cup in our rivers, and then our world's ocean! By
                    plantings trees increases
                    the value of nearby houses, increases tax
                    revenues, supports local businesses, decreases government
                    spending through the
                    natural provision of ecosystem services,
                    decreases the cost of recreation, and creates jobs.</p>
                <br>
                <h4><b>Investing:</b></h4>
                <p>Investing in beaches rivers streams and
                    creeks, as a strategy to lower pollution. Restoration
                    projects will enhance
                    economic value for the city's, community,
                    and beyond. Service learning project will are aimed to
                    focus on engaging high schools,
                    College Students, like Oregon State
                    University students, the community of Albany, and communities within the United States, straighten
                    wildlife habitat, improve
                    public health, strengthened neighborhoods, environmental
                    protection, that will improve
                    the drinking water for over two million
                    people who live downstream, and preservation of natural
                    beauty, all of which makes
                    communities more livable.
                    Evidence is proven, from academic research
                    and first-hand experience of community leaders and
                    government officials who
                    have found that urban stream restoration
                    protection does not “cost” but rather “pays.”</p>
