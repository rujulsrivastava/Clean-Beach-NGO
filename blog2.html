                    The salty ocean is that the ultimate
                    playground, for about anyone that enjoys the wild nature of the
                    outdoors filled with new adventures from
                    coral sands, sand dunes, tide pools to marine wildlife
                    which makes
                    beaches the excellent break spot for your place to recharge or just to get to know yourself.
                    However our oceans are in danger of
                    plastic bags near beaches or a state park or national park or
                    other locations near the barrier islands
                    our ocean needs your attention to help lower the threats of
                    plastic
                    pollution harming our gulf coast or shores and seas.
                    What Clean Beach Please has been
                    researching the most polluted locations you maybe spending you
                    vacations at
                    during your time off and this has helped
                    our team learn more about the perfect locations to host
                    beach cleanups
                    that make larger impacts. The Ocean is at
                    a large risk of being over consumed by plastic which
                    places all of us at
                    risk to the present environment, which all
                    we can do is help where we can to protect marine life and
                    save our beaches while doing so.</p>
