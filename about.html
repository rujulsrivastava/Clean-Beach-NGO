                    found its inspiration in a trip to Marina Beach.<br>
                    When we were travelling, we found out the beach was devastated by human wastes (plastic bags, glass
                    bottles, tires, metals…). We felt mix feelings: sad, guilty, revolted and
                    useless.
                    We wanted to do something but the waste was so huge that it was impossible for just the few of
                    us.<br>
                    When one week later, we saw in a National Park a monkey playing with a plastic bottle, we decided to
                    do something. This time, it was <b>manageable to collect it</b>. We went back to the entrance and
                    asked a plastic bag. In 20 minutes, we filled it in completely with waste and dumped it in a
                    dustbin.<br>
                    We felt <b>useful and proud of this simple action</b> and started to think of how it would be
                    fantastic if all travellers would do the same. Travellers are usually visiting the same
                    places and want to have a positive impact. So why not facilitating this?<br><br>
                    <span style="color:goldenrod; font-size: 20px; font-family:Arial,  Helvetica, sans-serif ">This is
                        how we came with the idea of Clean Beach Please: </span><span style="color:#0c61c9; font-size: 20px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, 
 sans-serif ">to reproduce our simple action at a larger scale.</span><br><br>
                    <b>Then, we started to talk to travelers and we realized we were many to think the same
                        thing.</b><br>
                    We found that the strong majority of travelers find places polluted with human waste during their
                    vacation or trips. Most of the time it is a small or medium size, meaning that 1
                    to 3 persons could collect it.
                    Although the majority of people finds this sad and revolting, only a minority of travelers cleaned
                    up what
                    they could while most of them did not do anything about it. Why ?<br>
                    Mainly for logistic reasons: they did not know in advance they will find it, they had no bags, they
                    did not know where to put it after. However, we found that they are willing to
                    spend some time during their vacation to do something for the beach.
                    Travelers have the motivation to clean but face logistics constraints.<br>
                    This is why we are creating Clean Beach Please : <span

                        facilitate the logistics so that only motivation remains.</span><br><br>
