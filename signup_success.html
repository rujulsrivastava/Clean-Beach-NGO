                    Along with participation of enthusiastic volunteers, there are some who cannot come on spot for help
                    but they help in organizing and funding the
                    volunteer drives.
                    These people are major contributors in the success of our mission as they help us by funding the
                    events which contributes in taking care of volunteers
                    during cleanliness drive, proper disposal of waste, and other money related matters.
